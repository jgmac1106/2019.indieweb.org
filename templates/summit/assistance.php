<p>The IndieWeb community is building the foundation of a web controlled by individuals for themselves. It's crucial to have independent web creators from all backgrounds at IndieWeb Summit to have a rich discussion and build cool things.</p>

<p>If you are a member of a group that is typically underrepresented (e.g. if you are not hetero, white, cis and male), and otherwise could not afford to travel to IndieWeb Summit on your own, generous donations from sponsors and other IndieWeb Summit attendees are able to be put towards a fund to assist individuals from underrepresented backgrounds with travel, lodging, and/or childcare costs for the Indieweb Summit in Portland.</p>

<p>If you think that you could benefit from this fund, please <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/jrqs8fIFhGUjYhGg2">apply here</a>. You needn't be an IndieWeb expert or master hacker, just an excited participant willing to share and learn.</p>

<p class="smaller">If you would like to contribute to this fund so that we can provide assistance to more individuals from a diverse background, please contact <a href="mailto:aaron@parecki.com">Aaron Parecki</a>.</p>
